# Animation Implementation Plan for Mixologist App

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of animation enhancements for the Mixologist Flutter app. Each animation will be implemented individually with git commits to allow for easy rollback if needed.

## Implementation Order

### 1. Animated Text Kit
**Priority: HIGH**
**Target Areas:**
- Search bar placeholder text cycling through cocktail suggestions
- AI assistant text responses with typewriter effect
- Recipe instructions appearing with animation
- Error/success messages with fade/scale effects

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `animated_text_kit` to pubspec.yaml
2. Update `ios_search_bar.dart` with rotating placeholder text
3. Enhance AI assistant message display with typewriter effect
4. Add animated text to recipe method cards
5. Create reusable animated text components

**Git Branch:** `feature/animated-text`

### 2. Shimmer Animation
**Priority: HIGH**
**Target Areas:**
- Recipe generation loading states
- Image loading placeholders
- Inventory item loading skeletons
- Search result loading states

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `shimmer` package to pubspec.yaml
2. Create reusable shimmer components for common patterns
3. Replace loading indicators in recipe generation
4. Add shimmer to image placeholders
5. Implement inventory loading skeletons

**Git Branch:** `feature/shimmer-loading`

### 3. Spring Physics Animations
**Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH**
**Target Areas:**
- Bottle card interactions (tap, add to inventory)
- Button press feedback throughout app
- Pull-to-refresh custom animation
- Modal/sheet presentations

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `spring` package to pubspec.yaml
2. Create spring-based button component
3. Enhance bottle card interactions
4. Implement custom pull-to-refresh
5. Add spring physics to modals

**Git Branch:** `feature/spring-animations`

### 4. Flutter Staggered Animations
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Target Areas:**
- Inventory shelf bottle appearance
- Search results cascading
- Recipe ingredients list
- Category filter chips

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `flutter_staggered_animations` to pubspec.yaml
2. Implement staggered grid for inventory
3. Add cascade effect to search results
4. Enhance recipe ingredient list appearance
5. Animate category filter chips

**Git Branch:** `feature/staggered-animations`

### 5. Material Motion (Animations Package)
**Priority: LOW-MEDIUM**
**Target Areas:**
- Hero transitions for cocktail images
- Container transforms for recipe cards
- Shared axis for navigation
- Fade through for screen changes

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `animations` package to pubspec.yaml
2. Implement hero animations for cocktail images
3. Add container transform to recipe cards
4. Enhance navigation transitions
5. Polish screen change animations

**Git Branch:** `feature/material-motion`

## Testing Protocol

For each implementation:
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement changes
3. Test on iOS simulator
4. Commit changes
5. Show demo to user
6. If approved: merge to main
7. If rejected: revert and document feedback

## Success Metrics

- Animations feel natural and enhance UX
- Performance remains smooth (60 FPS)
- Animations align with iOS design language
- Loading states feel more polished
- Micro-interactions feel delightful

## Rollback Plan

Each feature is implemented in its own branch with atomic commits:
```bash
# To revert a specific animation implementation
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/[animation-name]

# Or to revert a merged feature
git revert [commit-hash]
```

## Notes

- All animations should respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility settings
- Animations should be subtle and not distract from content
- Performance testing required for each implementation
- Document any custom animation curves or durations for consistency
