  "drink_image_description": "A classic Tom Collins served in a tall Collins glass filled with ice. The drink is a light, translucent yellow, garnished with a bright yellow lemon wheel and a vibrant red maraschino cherry on top. The setting is bright with natural lighting, emphasizing the refreshing and crisp nature of the cocktail. The camera angle is slightly above the glass, capturing the effervescent bubbles of the club soda and the condensation on the glass.",
  "drink_history": "The Tom Collins is a classic cocktail dating back to the mid-19th century. Named after a popular hoax and urban legend from New York in the 1870s, it became famous as a refreshing gin-based drink served in soda fountains and bars. Its simple combination of gin, lemon juice, sugar, and soda water made it a beloved summer cooler and a staple in cocktail culture.",
