The drink is a pale green hue from the fresh lime juice and tequila, garnished with a bright green lime wheel on the rim. The glass is set against a bright, sunny background with natural lighting that highlights the condensation on the glass and the salt crystals on the rim. The photo is taken from a slight top angle, capturing the inviting freshness and zest of the ingredients.",
