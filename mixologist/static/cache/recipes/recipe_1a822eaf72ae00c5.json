  "drink_image_description": "A perfectly crafted Pisco Sour in a classic coupe glass set on a bright surface with natural lighting. The frothy white foam from the egg white is topped with delicate drops of amber Angostura bitters, creating a contrast. The background is light and airy, capturing the essence of a refreshing South American cocktail. The camera angle is slightly above the glass to showcase the foam and bitters artfully.",
  "drink_history": "The Pisco Sour is a classic cocktail originating from Peru, with roots dating back to the early 20th century. It is considered the national drink of Peru and is celebrated for its unique blend of pisco, citrus, and frothy egg white. The cocktail was popularized by Victor Vaughen Morris, an American bartender who settled in Lima in the 1920s. It has since become an iconic drink symbolizing Peruvian culture and hospitality.",
