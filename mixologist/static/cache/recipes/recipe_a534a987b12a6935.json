  "drink_image_description": "A classic Boulevardier cocktail showcasing its deep amber color, served in a crystal-clear old-fashioned glass. The glass contains a large, perfectly clear ice cube, highlighting the rich blend of bourbon or rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Campari. An elegant orange twist rests on the rim, with warm, soft lighting accentuating the drink's amber hues against a bright background, captured from a slightly overhead angle to emphasize the drink's clarity and garnish.",
  "drink_history": "The Boulevardier is a classic cocktail that dates back to the Prohibition era in the United States. It is believed to have been created in the 1920s by an American expatriate in Paris named Erskine Gwynne, who was the editor of a monthly magazine called \"The Boulevardier.\" The drink shares a similar composition to the Negroni but substitutes gin with bourbon or rye whiskey, giving it a richer, warmer profile.",
