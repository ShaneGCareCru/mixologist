## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Documentation Accuracy Crisis
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Project planning and resource allocation  

The `INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` documents contain information that is not only outdated but fundamentally incorrect:

- Claims features need implementation when they're already live
- Provides integration instructions for already-integrated systems
- Misrepresents the current application's sophistication level
- Could lead to duplicate development work

**Recommendation**: Immediate documentation audit and correction

### Issue #2: Feature Discovery Gap
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Underutilization of existing capabilities  

Despite having an exceptionally sophisticated codebase, the planning documents suggest the team may not be fully aware of the current implementation's capabilities.

**Evidence of Sophisticated Implementation**:
- Custom painters with advanced algorithms
- Performance monitoring systems
- Accessibility compliance
- Memory management optimizations
- Platform-specific adaptations

### Issue #3: Strategic Planning Misalignment
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Development roadmap accuracy  

Future development planning may be based on incorrect assumptions about current implementation status.
